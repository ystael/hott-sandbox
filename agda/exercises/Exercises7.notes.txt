7.1. (a) If Π A:U. ∥A∥ → A, then in particular for any A and x, y: A,
we have ∥x = y∥ → (x = y).  Thus we can get a reflexive mere relation
implying identity: for any type A, define R(x, y) = ∥x = y∥, then R is
a mere relation and R(x, x) is inhabited by ∣refl_x∣, and the function
∥x = y∥ → (x = y) is the identity implication.  By 7.2.2 A is a set.

(b) (1) If f: A → 1 then fib_f(⋆) ≃ A, because fib_f(⋆) = Σ x:A. f(x) = ⋆,
and 1 is contractible, so ⋆ = ⋆ is contractible so fib_f(⋆) ≃
Σ x:A. 1 ≃ A.
(2) 1 → A ≃ A, the forward direction being "apply ⋆" and the back
direction being "constant function by induction on 1".  One equivalence
homotopy is definitional, the other is functional extensionality.
(3) Thus if every mere surjection splits, that is, if for any f: A → B
we have Π b:B. ∥fib_f(b)∥ → Π b:B. fib_f(b), then in particular this
is true when B = 1.  Then given any type A we can form a map ∥A∥ → A
as follows: let c: A → 1 be the constant function c(a) = ⋆, then send
∥A∥ → ∥fib_c(⋆)∥ [truncation induction on equivalence 1] →
Π b:1. ∥fib_c(b)∥ [2] → Π b:1. fib_c(b) [assumption] → fib_c(⋆) [2] →
A [1].  Now the hypothesis of (a) is satisfied, so all types are sets.

7.2. The diagram should look like
   1 → 1 → 1
    ↘↗ ↘↗
    ↗↘ ↗↘
   1 → 1 → 1
based on the conjecture: If D is a diagram with homotopy colimit A
(that is, for any type E, cocone_D(E) ≃ A → E), then the extended
diagram D′ :≡ 1 ⇚ D ⇛ 1 (that is, arrows from every object of D
to each copy of 1) has homotopy colimit ΣA (that is, for any type E,
cocone_D′(E) ≃ ΣA → E).  Given that, and the fact that we know the
diagram 1 1 has colimit S⁰, adding another pair of 1's below (to the
right) should give ΣS⁰ ≃ S¹, and a third pair should give ΣS¹ ≃ S².
